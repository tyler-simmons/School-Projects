How to use the spellchecker:

	1. Run with arguments
		server [arg1] [arg2]
		
		a) arg1: if there is a different dictionary besides the default supplied then
		   put the file name as arg1. The server will open the file in read only
		   or it will notify that the file does not exist and exit
		
		b) arg2: arg2 is the port to specify for the server to run on. The server
		   will notify if invalid argument present
		   
		c) If the server is given no arguments it will run using the defualt dictionary
		   (included in the archive) and it will use the default port for telnet (23).
		   If only the dictionary is supplied then the server will try to accept it and
		   then operate using default port.
		   
	2. Using the server with telnet
	
		a) For the sake of demonstration: the server can be connected to by using telnet 
		   with the ip address 127.0.0.1 (loopback) NOTE: Clients will not be able to 
		   connect without using the port that server is running on or connection will
		   be refused through telnet
		   
		b) Once a connection to server is established, the server will notify user if 
		   it is ready to start servicing spellcheck requests. If it is busy servicing
		   other clients, the client will be placed in a queue and notified when the
		   server is ready
		   
		c) At this point the user can give the server spell check request by typing 
		   the word to be checked into the terminal and pressing enter.
		   The server will respond with an echo of the word inputted with either: 
		   ***OK*** - word is spelled corectly
		   ***MISSPELLED*** - the word is spelled incorrectly
		   At this point, the user may enter additional words to be spell chekced. The
		   server will reamin connected and waiting for words until the telnet connection
		   is closed
